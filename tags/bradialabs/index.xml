&lt;p&gt;My name is Bryan, and I am an Electrical Engineer who loves writing software. I have written software for the electrical industry for 5+ years. In my spare time I like to learn about new technologies and try them out. I have written iPhone games for fun and various web projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not all nerd though. My family is my true passion in life. My beautiful wife and I have two amazing kids. As a parent I pretty much make everything up as I go, but it is so much fun! My wife does an amazing job holding everything together. We would be lost without her. I just wish we had more time for date nights&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
